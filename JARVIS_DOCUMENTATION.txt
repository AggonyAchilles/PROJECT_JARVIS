JARVIS DOCUMENTATION

*** Imports ***
----------------

JARVIS requires some libraries in order to operate on WINDOWS:

- tkinter
- tkinter.messagebox
- os
- time
- datetime
- urllib.request
- webbrowser

Eventough some if not all of the libraries are part of python, it is still a good practice to check wether they have been succesfully imported or not. If one library fails to get imported the program will shut down
